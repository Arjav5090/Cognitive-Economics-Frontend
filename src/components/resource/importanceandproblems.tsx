          1. Introduction to Housing Finance
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
          Housing is among the most critical pillars of social well-being,
          alongside education and healthcare. My fascination with housing and
          housing finance markets spans nearly 50 years, beginning with my
          undergraduate research at Cambridge. My early work explored how the
          inflation-driven rise in interest payments on adjustable-rate
          mortgages (ARMs) of the late 1970s influenced the U.K. savings rate. I
          hypothesized that high nominal but low real interest rates forced
          younger borrowers to reduce spending, while older asset holders were
          left worse off without increasing their spending.

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
          This foundational experience set the stage for a career-long focus on
          understanding and reforming housing finance systems.

          2. Identifying Problems in Housing Finance
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-justify leading-relaxed">
          Over the years, I have identified significant inefficiencies and
          inequities in the housing finance system, including:

          <li className="text-justify">
            <strong>Refinancing Constraints:</strong> In my paper Collateral
            Damage, we demonstrated how falling house prices lock homeowners
            into higher-rate mortgages, exacerbating economic challenges in
            depressed regions. This finding influenced the introduction of the
            FHAâ€™s streamline refinance program, which removed unnecessary
            underwriting barriers.

          <li className="text-justify">
            <strong>Expensive and Risky Pure Debt Finance:</strong> Standard
            mortgages and other purely debt-based housing finance options are
            needlessly expensive and highly risky during volatile economic
            times.

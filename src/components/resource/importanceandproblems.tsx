          1. Introduction to Housing Finance
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
          Housing is among the most critical pillars of social well-being, alongside education and healthcare.
          My fascination with housing and housing finance markets spans nearly 50 years, beginning with my
          undergraduate research at Cambridge. My early work explored how the inflation-driven rise in interest
          payments on adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) of the late 1970s influenced the U.K. savings rate. I
          hypothesized that high nominal but low real interest rates forced younger borrowers to reduce spending,
          while older asset holders were left worse off without increasing their spending.

        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
          This foundational experience set the stage for a career-long focus on understanding and reforming
          housing finance systems.

        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg text-justify leading-relaxed">
          Over the years, I have identified significant inefficiencies and inequities in the housing finance system, including:

          <li className="text-justify">
            <strong>Refinancing Constraints:</strong> In my paper Collateral Damage, we demonstrated how falling
            house prices lock homeowners into higher-rate mortgages, exacerbating economic challenges in depressed
            regions. This finding influenced the introduction of the FHAâ€™s streamline refinance program, which
            removed unnecessary underwriting barriers.
          </li>
          <li className="text-justify">
          <strong>Expensive and Risky Pure Debt Finance:</strong> Standard mortgages and other purely debt-based housing finance
            options are needlessly expensive and highly risky during volatile economic times.

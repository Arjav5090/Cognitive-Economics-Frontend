            1. Challenging Beginnings: The Impact of Childhood Deprivation and Instability
          </h2>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg">
            The CLP team is collaborating with developmental psychologists to examine how childhood economic
            instability affects career trajectories. Using the Questionnaire of Unpredictability in Childhood
            (QUIC), enriched with economic data, we are linking subjective childhood experiences to Danish
            administrative data. This project explores the alignment between subjective recollections and objective
            records, providing a foundation for understanding long-term economic outcomes.

            2. Premature Endings: How Many Careers End Unexpectedly?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg">
            Many workers leave the labor force before reaching traditional retirement ages. To uncover the drivers
            of premature exits, we are conducting surveys akin to "exit interviews" for retirees. These surveys
            investigate the predictability of retirement, the role of economic and health shocks, and the nature of
            surprises that influence career endings.

              female labor supply.

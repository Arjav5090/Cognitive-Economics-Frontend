            1. Challenging Beginnings: The Impact of Childhood Deprivation and
            Instability
          </h2>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg">
            The CLP team is collaborating with developmental psychologists to
            examine how childhood economic instability affects career
            trajectories. Using the Questionnaire of Unpredictability in
            Childhood (QUIC), enriched with economic data, we are linking
            subjective childhood experiences to Danish administrative data. This
            project explores the alignment between subjective recollections and
            objective records, providing a foundation for understanding
            long-term economic outcomes.

            2. Premature Endings: How Many Careers End Unexpectedly?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-sm sm:text-base lg:text-lg">
            Many workers leave the labor force before reaching traditional
            retirement ages. To uncover the drivers of premature exits, we are
            conducting surveys akin to "exit interviews" for retirees. These
            surveys investigate the predictability of retirement, the role of
            economic and health shocks, and the nature of surprises that
            influence career endings.

                conditional on education, IQ, numeracy, and other covariates. It
                is more valuable in management and other decision-intensive

                Introduces the Copenhagen Life Panel contingent earnings survey
                instrument and shows job transitions to be the key drivers of
                earnings risk. The survey reveals subjective earning risk to be
                many times smaller than traditional estimates suggest.

                Surveys firms to separate the role of on-the-job tenure from
                total experience in determining productivity growth. Finds
                evidence consistent with wages not being allocative
                period-by-period, and finds previous experience to be a less
                than perfect substitute for on-the-job tenure.

                female labor supply.

              . 2025.
              <p>
                We use a customized survey to identify the critical role of
                partner parental leave in shaping female employment after giving
                birth. Key findings:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mt-2">
                <li>
                  Women whose partners do not take leave remain out of the
                  workforce longer than they had expected to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Better communication would help: even when about to give
                  birth, many mothers remain highly uncertain whether or not
                  their partner will take leave. This is particularly the case
                  for first-time mothers.
